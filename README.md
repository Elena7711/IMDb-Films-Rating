# IMDb-Films-Rating

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is one of the most-visited websites in the world and the premier source for information on films. Similar to Wikipedia, much of IMDb's information is user contributed. IMDb also allows users to voice their opinion on the quality of films through voting. We investigate whether there is a connection between user voting data and economic film characteristics. The findings can help better understand the characteristics of each cluster. Popularity is a fairly important metric here on TMDB. It helps us boost search results, adds an incredibly useful sort value for discover, and is also just kind of fun to see items chart up and down. You can think of popularity as being a "lifetime" popularity score that is impacted by the attributes below. It's calculated quite differently than trending.
